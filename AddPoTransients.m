function AddPoTransients()
% AddPoTransients()
%
% Takes neuron and transient information in ExpTransients.mat, ProcOut.mat,
% and pPeak.mat and adds in missed transients.  For each potential
% transient for a given neuron, this function looks for calcium activity in
% each neighboring (buddy) neuron that is within the buddy distance
% threshold noted in the code below.  
%
% A new transient is added if three conditions are met: 
% 1) there are no transients in any of the buddy neurons identified on the 
% potentially active frames prior to the peak of the potential transient, 
% and 2) the peak of the transient is located in a plausible position 
% (where at least one prior transient peak occurred), and
% 3) the rank of the peak pixel across all transients is greater than the 
% threshold in the code below, calculated using all the previously
% confirmed transients.
%
%
% INPUTS - all are loaded from workspace variables
%
%   from pPeak.mat (see Calc_pPeak): pPeak and mRank
%
%   from ExpTransients (see ExpandTransients): PosTr, PoPosTr, PoTrPeakIdx
%
%   from ProcOut.mat (see MakeNeurons): NumNeurons, NumFrames, 
%   NeuronPixels, NeuronImage, Xdim, Ydim.
%
%
% OUTPUTS - saved in expPosTr.mat
%
%   expPosTr - expanded positive transients, a NumNeurons x NumFrames
%   logical array for final calcium transient activity
%
%   expPosIdx - indices to the mean-maximum pixel for each added transient
%   in expPosTr
%
%   buddies - indices to the each neuron's buddies
