function Calc_pPeak()
% Calc_pPeak
%
% Calculates statistics on the pixel intensity values for all transients
% for each neuron.  See OUTPUTS for specifics.
%
% INPUTS - all loaded from workspace variables
%
%   from ProcOut.mat (see MakeNeurons): NeuronPixels, NumNeurons,
%   NumNeurons.
%
%   from ExpTransients.mat (see ExpantTransients): all variables
%
% 
% OUTPUTS - saved in pPeak.mat
%
%   pPeak: for each neuron, the probability that each pixel in its
%   mask was the location of the peak intensity across all transients. Note
%   that pixel indices for neuron N correspond to those in NeuronPixels{N}
%   from ProcOut.mat, NOT those in NeuronImage{N}.
%
%   mRank: for each neuron, the mean rank of each pixel's intensity 
%   value across all transients.  See comment on pixel indices above.
