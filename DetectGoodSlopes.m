function [] = DetectGoodSlopes()
% DetectGoodSlopes
%
% Detects rising events for each neuron's transients.  Then,
% detects any rising events in buddy neurons (those with overlapping pixels) that
% occur concurrently and assigns the rising event to the neuron with the
% largest mean pixel intensity.
%
%
% INPUTS - all loaded from workspace variables
%
%   from ProcOut.mat (see MakeNeurons): NeuronPixels, NeuronImage
%
%   from NormTraces.mat (see NormalTraces): all variables
%
%   from expPosTr.mat (see AddPoTransients): all variables
%
%
% OUTPUTS - saved to T2Output
%
%   NeuronPixels: a 1 x NumNeurons cell with the pixel indices for each
%   neuron corresponding to NeuronImage, below.
%
%   NeuronImage: a 1 x NumNeurons cell with a binary array indicating the
%   each neuron's mask
%
%   FT: a NumNeurons x NumFrames array where 1 = rising event, 0 = no
%   detected calcium activity.
