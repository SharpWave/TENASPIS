function [] = ExpandTransients(Todebug)
% Takes the information from MakeNeurons (rough idea of when a transient is
% occuring for each neuron) and NormalTraces and identifies when traces
% actually start and end.  This is necessary because the output of
% MakeNeurons only identifies when large events that are easily separable
% from neighboring neurons are occurring.  This function identifies the
% actual start and end of the neuron's activity and fills in any missed
% transients.  Criteria = z-scored trace is above 0. 
%
% Additionally it also calculates potential future transients by looking
% for sections of a neuron's trace that exceed 25% of the smallest peak
% identified above.  These potential transients are vetted later in
% AddPoTransients.
%
% INPUTS - all loaded from worspace variables
%
%   from NormTraces.mat (see NormalTraces): trace, difftrace
%
%   from ProcOut.mat
%
%
% OUTPUTS - all saved in ExpTransients.mat
%
%   PosTr (Positive Transients): A NumNeurons x NumFrames logical array 
%   identified the start and end of the expanded transients identified by 
%   the criteria above.
%
%   PrePoPosTr (Pre-expansion Potential Positive Transients): Same format 
%   as PosTr, but for parts of the trace not identified by MakeNeurons (FT 
%   variable) that meet criteria for being a potential transient above.
%
%   PoPosTr (Potential Positive Transients): expanded version of the
%   PrePoPosTr
% 
%   PoTrPeakIdx (Potential Transient Peak Index) : A cell array where each 
%   entry contains the frame number index of peak value for each transient
%   for all neurons
%
%   PoNumTr (Potential Number of Transients): A 1 x NumNeurons array that
%   contains the number of potential transients for each neuron
%
%   MaxPeak: 1 x NumNeurons array containing the value of largest peak of
%   all transients identified in PosTr.
%
%   MinPeak: 1 x NumNeurons array containing the value of smallest peak of
%   all transients identified in PosTr.
