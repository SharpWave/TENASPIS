% one, whether there was one on the previous frame that matched it and if
% so which one, thus deducing calcium transients across frames
%
% OUTPUTS:
%
%   NumSegments: total number of valid segments identified from blobs
%
%   NumFrames: total number of frames in the movie
%
%   Xdim, Ydim: x/y size of all the imaging frames
%
%   SegChain: A cell array containing a list of all the transients
%   identified, of the form:
%   SegChain{Transient_number}.{[frame1, object_num1], [frame2, object_num2],...},
%   where object_numx is the object number in the cc variable from
%   ExtractBlobs for frame x.
%
%   max_trans_dist: maximum number of pixels a transient can travel without 
%   being discarded
%
%   TransientLength: length of each corresponding transient from SegChain
%   in frames
