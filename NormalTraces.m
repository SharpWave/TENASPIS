function [] = NormalTraces(moviefile)
% This function takes the ROI output of MakeNeurons and extracts
% traces in the straightfoward-most way (by summing up all the pixels in a
% given neuron's ROI. Also normalizes traces at the end and get their
% temporal derivative
%
% INPUTS - all loaded from workspace variables
%
%   from ProcOut.mat (see MakeNeurons): NeuronImage, NumFrames,
%   NeuronPixels
%
% OUTPUTS - saved in NormTraces.mat
%
%   trace: a smoothed, normalized (z-scored) trace for each neuron
%
%   difftrace: temporal derivative of trace
