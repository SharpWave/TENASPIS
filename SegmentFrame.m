function [cc,PeakPix,NumItsTaken,threshlist] = SegmentFrame(frame,mask,thresh)
% [frame,cc,ccprops] = SegmentFrame(frame,mask,thresh)
%
%   Identifies local maxima and separates them out into neuron sized blobs.
%   Does so in an adaptive manner by iteratively bumping up the threshold
%   until no new blobs are identified.
%
%   INPUTS:
%
%       frame: a frame from an braing imaging movie
%
%       mask: a logical array the same size as frame indicating which areas
%       have valid neurons (ones) and which do not (zeros)
%
%       thresh: the starting value at which you will threshold the values in
%       frame to being looking for blobs
%
%   OUTPUTS:
%
%       cc: structure variable containing all the relevant data/statistics 
%       about the blobs discovered (e.g. the pixel indices for each blob) 
%
%       PeakPix: a cell array with the x/y pixel indices for the location 
%       of the peak pixel intensity for each blob.
%
%       NumItsTaken: number of iterations taken to identify each blob.
